# Admin Client-Side

Welcome to the client-side of my "Admin app" project.
This repository is part of my "learn by doing" approach to mastering Django,
React, and eventually developing microservices. 

I have been following an older Udemy course,
available at https://www.udemy.com/course/react-django-admin, that is about three years old.
As a result, I had to make significant modifications to the code to get it to work.
However, this course is an essential stepping stone to my next objective of learning how to develop microservices with Django and Python.

My motivation for selecting this specific course is the fascination I have for the subject of microservices.
In this application, I will be creating a React app that is somewhat dated,
following the instructor's guidance with some modifications and improvements.
This app will request services from a Django application that exists within a Docker container.
The Django application is part of my "Admin Server-Side" project.
